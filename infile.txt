**Vault-Tec Report #325: The Forsaken Ruins**

_Dated: October 25, 2077_

This worn piece of parchment, now decades old, tells a chilling tale of the Forsaken Ruins
- a once-thriving settlement that bore witness to a grim event, known as the "Radiant Outbreak."
The town's inhabitants, burdened by an insatiable hunger for knowledge, inadvertently unleashed a cataclysmic force that swept through the town like wildfire.

In the heart of the Forsaken Ruins lies a decimated library, its shelves scorched and books reduced to ashes. Amongst the charred remains, one tome stands alone.
The last testament of a researcher named Doctor Evelyn Harlow, who was determined to unlock the secrets of the universe.
Her quest for knowledge ultimately led to her downfall, as she opened a forbidden tome known as the "Codex of the Abyss."

The Codex's power was unleashed upon the town, transforming its residents into grotesque, irradiated creatures.
Driven by insatiable hunger for wisdom, they roam the ruins to this day, searching for any fragment of knowledge they can find.
These beings, now known as the "Scholars of Desolation," serve as a dire warning of the consequences of unchecked curiosity in the post-apocalyptic world.

As you read this note, you can't help but wonder what knowledge lies within the Codex of the Abyss and what secrets it could hold for those brave enough to seek it.
